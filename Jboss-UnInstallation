. Stop the JBoss Server
First, ensure that the JBoss server is not running:

If JBoss was started manually using a script:


# Navigate to the JBoss bin directory
cd /path/to/jboss/bin

# Stop the JBoss server
./jboss-cli.sh --connect command=:shutdown
If JBoss is running as a service:


sudo systemctl stop jboss
2. Disable the JBoss Service (if applicable)
If you have set up JBoss to run as a system service, disable it to prevent it from starting automatically on boot:


sudo systemctl disable jboss
3. Remove the JBoss Installation Directory
Remove the JBoss installation directory. Replace /path/to/jboss with the actual installation path of your JBoss server:

sudo rm -rf /path/to/jboss
Example:


sudo rm -rf /opt/jboss
4. Remove JBoss User (if a dedicated user was created)
If you created a specific user for running JBoss, you might want to remove that user:


sudo userdel -r jboss
5. Clean Up Environment Variables
If you have set any environment variables for JBoss, such as JBOSS_HOME in your shell configuration file (~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, or /etc/environment), you should remove or comment them out.

Open the configuration file with a text editor:


nano ~/.bashrc
Look for lines like this and remove them:


export JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/jboss
export PATH=$PATH:$JBOSS_HOME/bin
Then, apply the changes:

source ~/.bashrc
6. Remove Systemd Service File (if applicable)
If JBoss was configured to run as a systemd service, you might have a service file like /etc/systemd/system/jboss.service. Remove it:

sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/jboss.service
Then reload the systemd daemon to apply changes:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
7. Remove Log and Configuration Files (if necessary)
If there are any leftover log or configuration files, you might want to remove them. This might include directories such as:


sudo rm -rf /var/log/jboss
sudo rm -rf /etc/jboss
8. Verify Removal
To ensure that JBoss is fully uninstalled, check if any JBoss-related processes are still running or if any files remain:


ps aux | grep jboss
If any processes are still running, you can kill them using their process ID (PID):

sudo kill -9 <PID>
And to find any remaining files:

bash
Copy code
sudo find / -name "*jboss*"
